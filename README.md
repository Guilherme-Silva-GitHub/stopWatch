The JavaScript Stopwatch Project is a web-based application designed to provide users with a versatile and easy-to-use stopwatch experience. 
Built with HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality, this project offers a reliable and responsive stopwatch for various timekeeping needs.

JavaScript is employed to implement the core stopwatch functionality, including starting, pausing, and resetting the timer.
Users can initiate the stopwatch by clicking the "Start" button, pause it with the "Stop" button, and reset to zero using the "Reset" button.
